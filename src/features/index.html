<h1>Features</h1>

<div class="row">
    <div class="span4">
        <h3>Built-in watchdog</h3>
        Ubic includes <code>ubic.watchdog</code> service out of the box.
    </div>

    <div class="span4">
        <h3>Global service tree</h3>
        All services are accessible with a single command.
        For example, <code>ubic status</code> will show the statuses of every service.
    </div>

    <div class="span4">
        <h3>Custom status checks</h3>
        Running process is not necessarily a working process.
        Write custom code for additional status checks.
    </div>
</div>
<div class="row">
    <div class="span4">
        <h3>Polymorphic service classes</h3>
        Encapsulate your service-specific code in class and reuse it everywhere.
        Anything that looks like service can be started with ubic (example: init scripts).
        And then you can benefit from ubic's common infrastucture: pretty command-line frontend, watchdog, http status check server, etc.
    </div>

    <div class="span4">
        <h3>Code reuse</h3>
        Don't repeat yourself! Encapsulate your service-specific code and project policies in a base class and reuse it.
    </div>

    <div class="span4">
        <h3>Populate service tree dynamically</h3>
        If you need to run many services, you don't have to write separate config file for each one.
        Instead, you can describe all of them at once with multiservice.
    </div>
