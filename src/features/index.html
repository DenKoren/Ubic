        <h3>Built-in watchdog</h3>
        Ubic includes <code>ubic.watchdog</code> service out of the box.
    </div>

    <div class="span4">
        <h3>Global service tree</h3>
        All services are accessible with a single command.
        For example, <code>ubic status</code> will show you the statuses of every service.
    </div>

    <div class="span4">
        <h3>Custom status checks</h3>
        Running process isn't necessarily a working process.
        Write any custom code for additional status checks.
    </div>

<div class="row">
    <div class="span4">
        <h3>Polymorphic service classes</h3>
        Encapsulate your service-specific code in class and reuse it everywhere.
        Anything that looks like service can be started with ubic, for example, init scripts.
        And then you can benefit from ubic's common infrastucture: pretty command-line frontend, watchdog, http status check server, etc.
    </div>

    <div class="span4">
        <h3>Code reuse</h3>
        Don't repeat yourself! Encapsulate your service-specific code and project policies in a base class and reuse it.
    </div>

    <div class="span4">
        <h3>Populate service tree dynamically</h3>
    </div>
